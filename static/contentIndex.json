According to the Credential Engine, the number of microcredentials in engineering fields has grown by 112% between 2020 and 2023 (Credential Engine, 2023). Industry partnerships are driving this trend, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM developing specialized engineering credentials that are increasingly recognized alongside traditional degrees. Engineering schools are responding by unbundling degree programs into stackable credentials that allow for customized learning pathways.

If such theories gain experimental validation, an entirely new domain of “quantum consciousness engineering” could emerge, focused on designing systems that interface with or augment cognitive processes at the quantum level. The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research laboratory, despite its controversial status, reported statistically significant results suggesting potential mind-matter interactions at quantum scales (PEAR, final report 2022). While firmly in the realm of speculative science, several prestigious universities including Cambridge, ETH Zurich, and the National University of Singapore have established cross-disciplinary research initiatives exploring the theoretical frameworks for quantum biological interactions in cognitive systems (Quantum Biology Consortium, 2023).
